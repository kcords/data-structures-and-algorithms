# Array Binary Search
Given a list and a search key, return the index containing a match. If none exists, return -1.

## Whiteboard Process

## Approach & Efficiency

I opted for the loop approach over the recursive approach as I feel like it's simpler to follow visually

Time: O(log N)
Space: O(N)

## Solution
This is a white board only challenge.
