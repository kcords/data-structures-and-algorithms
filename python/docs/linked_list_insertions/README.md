# Challenge Title
Linked list insertions

## Whiteboard Process
![White Board](White%20Board.png)

## Approach & Efficiency
Each of these methods traverse the linked list until reaching either the desired insertion point or the end of the linked list.

All three methods are O(n) time complexity and O(1) space complexity.

## Solution
Testing can be performed by running `pytest` or accessing the file directly using `python3 data_structures/linked_list.py`
